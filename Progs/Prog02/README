Algorithm
---------------------------------------------------

main()
- Main
    - Creates a grid using a lists of lists
    - Utilize a switch to determine arguments
    - Asks for user input for num gens and simulates


gameOfLife()
- Start the Game of Life simulation
    - Gets amount and values of neighbors
    - Empties and resetting age if cell "dies"
    - Increment age if conditions are met
    - Populates and ages if overcrowded
- Returns the grid


neighborCheck()
- Returns list of neighboring cells for usage in Game of Life
    - Creates an array of values from the neighbors
    - Populates with every value around a cell
- Returns the neighborVal array


getState()
- Reads in the file Grid State
    - Reads the provided file and removes every space and \n
    - Sets the grid values based on the chars fed in


randomize()
- Randomizes Grid if no arg is given


printGrid()
- Prints Grid
